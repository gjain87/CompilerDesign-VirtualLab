# CompilerDesign-VirtualLab

In this virtual lab project, you will gain hands-on experience with the fundamental stages of compiler design by building a simple compiler for a small subset of a programming language. The project will be conducted in a simulated environment, allowing you to experiment and test your compiler without the need for complex setup or hardware resources.

Project Objectives:

Understand the key stages of compiler design: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.
Implement basic lexical analysis using finite state automata (FSA) or regular expressions.
Design and build a parser for a small grammar using techniques like LL(1) or LR(1) parsing.
Perform semantic analysis to check for type errors and other semantic inconsistencies.
